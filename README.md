# Description
We present a joint semi-parametric model for several possibly related multi-state processes (Seemingly Unrelated Multi-State Models, SUMS), assuming a Markov structure for the transition model. The dependence between different processes is captured by specifying a joint random effect distribution on the transition rates of each process. We assume a nonparametric prior for the random effect distribution, to allow for clustering of the individuals, overdispersions and outliers. Moreover, the precision matrix of the random effect distribution is modelled conditionally to a graph which describes the dependence structure between processes, exploiting tools from the Gaussian Graphical model literature. In this framework, it is also possible to include covariates effect. In this repository, an R/C++ package for th eimplementation of SUMS is provided.
